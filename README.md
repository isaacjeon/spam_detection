# spam_detection

This project uses the [SMS Spam Collection Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/uciml/sms-spam-collection-dataset) from Kaggle.

The goal of this project is to use several unsupervised learning techniques for dimensionality reduction for a binary classification spam detection task with logistic regression as well as for clustering with K-Means.
