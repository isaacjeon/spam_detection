# spam_detection

This project is in the form of a Jupyter notebook.

The goal of the project is to build models that predict depression for a person given several attributes about that person.

It involves performing some exploratory data analysis and data cleaning, followed by training and evaluates models built using several approaches which include Random Forests, gradient boosting with XGBoost, and Support Vector Machines.
